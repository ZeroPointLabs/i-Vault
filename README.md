# VaultFactory
A new protocol to handle payments and distribution for Web3 / DApps.

## Problem
No known standard or protocol simply handles the payments and distribution properly for DApps.

## Solution
VaultFactory manages deployment of Vaults based around a team authentication layer, which combines the use of ERC20 & ETH, and a splitter.
